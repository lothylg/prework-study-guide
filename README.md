# prework study guide webpage
A study guide for course pre-work.
# <Get it done before class starts!>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? I didn't want to already be behind for class, I wanted to be ready on the first day
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") I wanted to see how the changes I made can manipulate a website and see it applied in real time
- What problem does it solve? I didn't know how to write the code to be able to create a webpage and now I have introductory knowledge of it. 
- What did you learn? I learned a lot, HTML is the skeleton of the page, css gives it flare, javascript gives it the spinning rainbow wheel.

## Usage

This study guide will be used as a reference for code - in no way will I remember every single definition so it'll be nice to have some where to look at.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
